# Tiny Web Dev Projects

This repository is a collection of small web development projects created for my personal practice. I have mostly used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for these projects. Many of them are exercises that I have learned and practiced through bite-sized tutorials from YouTube, Udemy, and written guides on platforms like Medium and KDnuggets. Credits to all the amazing content creators.
