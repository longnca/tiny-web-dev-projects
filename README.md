# Tiny Web Dev Projects

This repository is a collection of small web development projects created for my personal practice.

I have mostly used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for these projects. These projects are directly inspired by bite-sized tutorials from YouTube, Udemy, etc.

## List of the projects:

| Project name  | Brief description     | Link  |
| ---   | ---     | ---  |
| Form Validator | A simple sign up form with error checking | [Link](/form-validator/) |
| Expanding cards | An effect of carousel of cards that can expand when clicking on them | [Link](/expanding-cards/) |
